AI and Java are, by their very nature, complex.
Even the simplest ideas and implementations are fraught with layers of
details necessary to getting anything working
but also complications that are enemies of transparency and reliability
even for seasoned professionals, not to mentions newcomers.

Thus, we put forward two pedagogical hypotheses as the antidote:
1. Students create their own knowledge
   through hands-on exercises -- this is Piaget's
   [constructivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)) theory of education.
   
2. In doing so, it is more effective
   to start with basic concepts which can then be scaled up in sophistication
   and applied to more real-world problems, if necessary -- this is our
   [crawl-before-one-walks](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/crawl_before_one_walks) theory of education.

This project is an original introduction to AI using Java following Piaget's model.
The main emphasis is on learning algorithms for
artificial neural networks (ANNs) using [Encog](https://www.heatonresearch.com/encog/) and
natural language processing (NLP) using [Apache OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/).
