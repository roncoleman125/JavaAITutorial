LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. Dollars are offered by four major banks in
the London market selected by the Calculation Agent after consultation with the Collateral Manager (the “Reference Banks”)
at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on the Interest Determination Date to prime banks in the London interbank market
for a period approximately equal to such period and an amount approximately equal to the amount of the Aggregate
Outstanding Amount of the Secured Notes. The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each Reference
Bank to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean
of such quotations (rounded upward to the next higher 1/100,000).
