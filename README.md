AI and Java by their nature are complex.
Thus, we put forward two pedagogical hypotheses as the antidote:
1. Students create their own knowledge -- this is Piaget's
   [constructivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)) theory of education.
   
2. In doing so, it is more effective
   to start with basic concepts which can then be scaled up in sophistication
   and applied to more real-world problems, if necessary -- this is our
   [crawl-before-one-walks](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/crawl_before_one_walks) theory of education.

This project is an original introduction to AI using Java following Piaget's model.
The main emphasis is on learning algorithms for
artificial neural networks (ANNs) using [Encog](https://www.heatonresearch.com/encog/) and
natural language processing (NLP) using [Apache OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/).
