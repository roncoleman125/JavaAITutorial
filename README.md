AI and Java are, by their very nature, complex.
There's just no way around it, we argue.
Thus, we put forward two pedagogical principles as the antidote:
1. Students create their own knowledge
   through hands-on exercises (this is Piaget's
   [constructivist] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)) theory of education).
   
2. In doing so, it is more effective
   to start with basic concepts which can then be scaled up in sophistication
   and applied to more real-world problems, if necessary (this is the so-called
   "crawl-before-you-can-walk" theory of education).

In other words, we prefer to trade completeness for simplicity when the two are in conflict.

This project is an original introduction to AI using Java founded on Piaget's model.
The main emphasis is on learning algorithms for
artificial neural networks (ANNs) using [Encog](https://www.heatonresearch.com/encog/) and
natural language processing (NLP) using [Apache OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/).
